# The file name that a wheel gets when it is built for the system Nix
# builds for, from the name it got on the system that a purifier's lock
# run built it on. It comes from poetry-purifier, whose lock run records
# the name of the project's wheel. A pure wheel (platform tag `any`) has
# the same name everywhere. A compiled wheel
# has its CPython tags rewritten for this Python, and its platform tag for
# this CPU and glibc:
#
# - `linux_<cpu>` is the tag of setuptools and most other build backends.
# - `manylinux_2_<glibc minor>_<cpu>` is the tag poetry-core gives a wheel
#   with a build script: the first tag `packaging` reports for the system it
#   builds on.
