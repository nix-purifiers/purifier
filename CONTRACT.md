# The purifier contract

Every nix-purifier meets this contract, so that a developer who knows one
purifier knows them all. The contract covers the Nix interface, the
commands, the checks and the README. Each purifier's lockfile format stays
its own, because each one models its own ecosystem.

The contract is the standard every purifier aims for. Where a build tool
cannot support part of it, the purifier's README states that part and what
the purifier does instead, in the section the part belongs to.

In this document, `<tool>` is the purifier's tool name as its repository
names it, such as `cargo` in `cargo-purifier`, and `<Tool>` is the same name
capitalized, such as `Cargo`.

## The user workflow

The entry point is the developer's existing build-tool workflow with a
lockfile and Nix-resolved dependencies. The developer installs the
purifier's native plugin where the tool supports it, or activates its
wrapper, hook, cache or environment integration, then locks the project
and runs normal build, test and editor commands. Those development
commands run outside the Nix sandbox against the prepared dependencies.
Dependency packages may themselves need Nix builds.

Building the project itself in the Nix sandbox is an optional next step.
At that point, recommend a Nix build definition in the project's source
tree or in an external packaging repository. Both paths consume the same
lockfiles. A project Nix definition is not a prerequisite for the native
development workflow.

A native plugin should have a native installation path. A purifier may
serve its ecosystem's packages through its own GitHub Pages repository,
as sbt-purifier serves Maven artifacts. Document which installation paths
are published and usable; a Pages site alone is not a package release.
When the tool has no suitable plugin interface, document the wrapper or
prefetch setup its normal commands require.

Wrappers must be installable, with the exact package and activation steps
in the README. A wrapper can be required when the native tool has no better
integration path; say so explicitly. Installing a wrapper must not require
adopting lockfiles in every project. With no applicable lockfile, print a
warning on standard error and delegate to the normal tool with its ordinary
impure resolution, preserving arguments, standard streams and exit status.
Do not create a purifier lock as a side effect of an unlocked native command.
An existing invalid or stale lock is an error, rather than an excuse to
silently switch to impure resolution. Explicit dependency-update commands
and documented opt-out settings may deliberately use the network.

## Source state

Git-dependent build behavior belongs to the source input, not to the dependency
lock. Changing commits, branches, tags or working-tree contents must not require
a dependency relock. A sandboxed builder that needs Git state consumes an
explicit source-state snapshot alongside the source tree; both participate in
its Nix build identity. The shared `sourceInput` model describes this pairing.

Capture only the selected refs, objects and index/remote facts needed by the
native behavior, with explicit history boundaries. Preserve object identities
and working-tree/index differences. Capture or refresh live remote facts
explicitly; replay must use captured inputs without contacting the remote.
Validate native behavior, including version and publication metadata, against
the original checkout. Missing required state is an error, not permission to
fabricate history, assume a clean tree, skip a check or invent a version.
The shared model alone does not implement capture/replay or enable a builder.

## The builder

A purifier's flake exports `overlays.default`, which adds one attribute to
the package set: the purifier's scope, `<tool>-purifier`, made with
`lib.makeScope`. The scope holds the builder, `build<Tool>Project`, beside
the purifier's command and plugin. The builder is a package for
`callPackage` in that scope: it takes the packages it needs by name, such
as `stdenvNoCC`, and `build<Tool>Project.override` replaces any of them.
`<tool>-purifier.overrideScope` replaces what everything in the scope
shares. A flake that packages a project, in the project's repository or in
another one, applies the overlay and calls the builder:

```nix
packages.${system}.default =
  (pkgs.<tool>-purifier.build<Tool>Project { src = ./.; }).packages.<name>;
```

The builder takes these arguments:

```nix
build<Tool>Project {
  src,
  lockFile ? src + "/<tool>-purifier.lock.json",
  <toolLock> ? src + "/<the build tool's lockfile>",
  fetchers ? { },
  # and the purifier's own arguments
}
```

`<toolLock>` is named after the build tool's own lockfile, such as
`cargoLock` for Cargo.lock, `packageLock` for package-lock.json and
`denoLock` for deno.lock. A purifier whose build tool has no lockfile of
its own has no such argument.

We recommend committing both lockfiles to the project's repository, and
the builder and the commands look for them there by default. A project can
instead keep its build external: the flake that calls the
builder keeps the purifier lockfile outside the tree and passes it as
`lockFile`. That flake can also keep its own copy of the build tool's
lockfile and pass it as `<toolLock>`, which the build then uses in place
of the copy in `src`. An external build of a project whose committed
lockfile is missing, stale or written by another version of the build tool
builds this way, from its source as published.

`fetchers` is passed unchanged to `fetchEntry` of the `purifier` library,
and to `tree`. A company mirror or credentials go into `fetchers.fetchurl`,
and that one hook works the same way in every purifier.

The builder's result has these attributes:

- `packages.<name>`: what the project builds, under names the purifier
  chooses for its ecosystem.
- `tests`: the project's test run in the sandbox.
- `release`: the artifact that `<tool>-purifier publish` uploads, built by
  Nix.
- `fetches`: the `purifier` library entries that the build fetches. SBOM,
  license and vulnerability tools read this list in every ecosystem.

Every attribute name in the result is known at evaluation time, with no
import-from-derivation.

## The lock in memory

Every purifier reads its lockfiles, the build tool's and its own, into one
attribute set of the same shape, whatever their formats on disk:

```nix
lib.<tool>-purifier.readLock { src, lockFile ? ..., <toolLock> ? ... }
# =>
{
  purifier = "<tool>-purifier";
  entries = [ /* download entries of the purifier library */ ];
  outputs = { /* <name> = { ... }, every name known at evaluation */ };
  problems = [ /* why the lockfiles cannot be used, each naming the fix */ ];
}
```

Each entry in `entries` may carry `systems`, a list of Nix systems,
when it is needed only there. An entry without `systems` is needed
everywhere. `problems` is empty for a usable lock, and holds a message for
each stale, tampered, malformed or incomplete lockfile. A lockfile that is
not valid JSON or TOML at all cannot become a problem, because Nix cannot
catch a parse error. `readLock` then fails evaluation with
`builtins.addErrorContext` naming the command that fixes it, and the
purifier's commands check the file before Nix reads it.

The builder fails evaluation when the lock has problems, with those
problems as the message, or when the lock does not have the shape above. It
fetches only the entries whose `systems` include the system it builds for,
and the entries that have no `systems`. Its `fetches` attribute is the
entries of the lock. A tool that reads every
purifier, such as an SBOM generator, calls `readLock` and reads this one
shape.

## The lockfile

A purifier reuses the build tool's own lockfile wherever it records the
downloads. It writes `<tool>-purifier.lock.json`, next to the build
tool's lockfile or at the external path, only for what the build tool's
lockfile cannot record. A purifier whose build
tool records everything writes no lockfile of its own.

Every purifier lockfile holds a format `version` and a hash of its own
content. A stale, tampered, malformed or incomplete lockfile fails, in the
command and at Nix evaluation, with a message that names the command that
fixes it.

## The commands

Every purifier has these commands. Where the build tool has a plugin
mechanism, the purifier is a plugin, and the command should be a thin
wrapper around the plugin's task.

- `<tool>-purifier lock` runs the build tool and records the downloads.
  When the build tool has its own lockfile, `lock` keeps the resolution
  that lockfile records, and writes the lockfile only where it is missing
  or incomplete. A relock of an
  unchanged project reproduces the lockfile byte for byte.
- `<tool>-purifier update [<package>...]` updates every lockfile in one
  run: it re-resolves through the build tool's own update, such as
  `cargo update` or `uv lock --upgrade`, and then relocks the purifier
  lockfile against the result. With package names, it updates only those
  packages, as the build tool's update does. A build tool with no lockfile
  of its own re-resolves its version ranges and dynamic versions, and the
  purifier lockfile is the one lockfile that changes.
- `<tool>-purifier prefetch` realizes, in the Nix store, everything the
  lockfile lists for the current system that day-to-day development needs:
  the build's downloads, the test dependencies, the toolchain, and what
  the editor asks for, such as source jars and language-server workers. It
  keeps them alive with a garbage-collector root beside the purifier
  lockfile. After a prefetch, the development loop and the editor work with
  the network cut off.
- `<tool>-purifier publish` uploads the `release` that Nix built.

Each command finds the purifier lockfile next to the build tool's own
lockfile. For an external build, it takes `--lockfile <path>` or the
environment variable `<TOOL>_PURIFIER_LOCKFILE`, such as
`CARGO_PURIFIER_LOCKFILE`, and either one takes precedence over the
default. The same goes for the build tool's lockfile, through
`--tool-lockfile <path>` or `<TOOL>_PURIFIER_TOOL_LOCKFILE`: with either
one, `lock` and `update` write the build tool's lockfile there and leave
the copy in the tree as it is, and `lock` starts from the copy in the tree
when the outside one does not exist yet. The dev shell of the flake that
calls the builder can set both variables to the paths it passes to the
builder, so a developer in that shell runs the commands with no flag.

The development loop goes through the build tool's own command, such as
`cargo build` or `sbt test`, with the locked downloads. Commands that need
a download not in the lock stop with a message that names
`<tool>-purifier lock`.

## The checks

Every purifier's flake has these checks, on x86_64-linux and
aarch64-linux, and its CI runs them on both:

| Check | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `conformance-stale` | A lockfile older than the project fails, naming the command to run. |
| `conformance-tampered` | A lockfile with a changed hash fails. |
| `conformance-missing` | A lockfile without a needed entry fails, naming the command to run. |
| `conformance-malformed` | A lockfile that is not valid fails, naming the command to run. |
| `conformance-relock` | Relocking a fixture reproduces its lockfile byte for byte. |
| `conformance-rebuild` | `nix build --rebuild` of a fixture gives the same output. |
| `conformance-offline` | After `prefetch`, the development loop of a fixture works with no network. |
| `conformance-update` | `update` on a fixture that pins an old version moves it, and both lockfiles then pass the stale check. |
| `conformance-external` | A fixture kept external, whose `src` holds only the build tool's own files, builds from a purifier lockfile outside it. Where the build tool has a lockfile, the fixture also builds when the flake replaces that lockfile with one outside `src`. |

A check that needs the network, such as a relock, runs in CI as a job of
the same name when the sandbox cannot run it.

## The README

Every purifier's README has these sections, in this order:

1. Quickstart
2. Development loop
3. Working offline
4. Editor
5. Troubleshooting
6. Supported language repositories
7. Examples
8. Credits

The Quickstart installs or activates the integration, locks the project,
and runs the build tool's normal development commands on Nix-resolved
dependencies. Show the actual plugin declaration, wrapper activation,
prefetch or environment setup that those commands need. State what runs
locally and what Nix realizes. Do not imply that an unconfigured stock
tool uses the Nix-resolved dependencies.

The Development loop continues with ordinary build, test and editor
commands and explains how to relock after dependency changes. Examples
lead with that same workflow on a real project.

An optional "Building the project with Nix" section follows the native
workflow. Recommend a flake or another Nix definition in the source tree,
or an externalized build, and show how it calls the builder with the same
lockfiles. One-off `nix build --impure --expr` commands belong in this
optional reference, rather than the Quickstart.

The builder must also work with a supplied package set through its
overlay, including ambient `<nixpkgs>`, rather than replacing it with its
own pinned nixpkgs. Document compatible toolchain versions and any
required nixpkgs version. A direct expression may use the purifier's
pinned nixpkgs to match its lock command, or import `<nixpkgs>` from the
user's Nix search path. This capability remains available even when the
recommended packaging example uses a project Nix definition.
